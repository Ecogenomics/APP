This is a collection of PERL wrappers which wrap QIIME. uclust and acacia
to perform basic QA and results analysis for 16S rRNA pyrotag datasets

Also contained in this package is a set of scripts for taking information generated
using PyroDB and doing a number of useful things such as sorting reads into folders
and generating csv files for dilition using an epi pipette robot.
